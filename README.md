Date: 23 Nov 2018

This program aims to generate images with specific styles. 
For example, this is the original image:

<img src="https://github.com/PokoFang/Style_Transfer/blob/master/image/content.jpg" width="300px" />

Here are some styles:

<img src="https://github.com/PokoFang/Style_Transfer/blob/master/image/style_kusamayayoi.jpg" width="300px" /> <img src="https://github.com/PokoFang/Style_Transfer/blob/master/image/style_starnight.jpg" width="300px" />

Following are the generated images with these styles:

<img src="https://github.com/PokoFang/Style_Transfer/blob/master/output/turtle_k200.png" width="300px" /> <img src="https://github.com/PokoFang/Style_Transfer/blob/master/output/turtle_sn200.png" width="300px" />

This program takes the deep learning courses provided by Andrew Ng on coursera as reference.
